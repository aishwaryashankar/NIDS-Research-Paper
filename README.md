# Network-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) - Research Review Paper

### Project for SJSU's CMPE 206 (Computer Network Design) course

I've written an IEEE-style research review paper on network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS), examining their applications, detection methodologies (including signature-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection), and the latest advancements in NIDS leveraging deep learning. I presented my work to the graduate-level computer networking seminar at San Jose State University.
